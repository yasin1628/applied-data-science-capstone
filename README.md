I have included the pdf Report that explains every detail, from introducing the project and the goals, through the whole process. Insight is gained from the data analysis and it leads to the final Conclusions.

I have also uploaded the Data Science Professional Certificate itself. You can verify it by following the link down on the right on the certificate. Once you open the link, you can find the grades for the 10 courses listed below, all showing 100/100 grades.

I hope you enjoyed this project as I did and please feel free to ask questions or suggest any change
